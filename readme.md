# HWRK4
## Description
This project is a quiz game that tests the user's knowledge of JavaScript programming language. The game is timed, and the user is presented with a series of questions, one at a time. When the user answers a question, the next question is presented. If the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. At the end of the game, the user can save their names and their score to see how they did compared to other players. This project provides an interactive and engaging way for users to test their JavaScript knowledge while also providing a competitive edge to motivate users to do their best.
